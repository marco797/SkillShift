# Skill Shift

Skill Shift is a personal project that I am using to learn as much as possible
about fullstack development, with the inclusion of Machine Learning (in the future).
Programming is always been a secondary skill for me, so I will need the use of GPT
systems to help me to achieve my goal. I am convinced that the role of an engineer
is to deal with the architecture of the software, more than the code behind it.
So I embrace the use of AI resources!

### üöÄ Goal

The final goal of Skill Shift is to evaluate the user profession, and tell how likely
is to be replaced by AI systems. Moreover, through Machine Learning, the system will 
suggest the user alternative jobs and professions less likely to be replaced, based on the
skillset given through a form.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This is the suggested framework, which will eventually change whether I find it convenient. I wanted to include AWS 
because of its wide usage in the industry.

| Frontend | Backend | ML Matching | Hosting             | Tools                 |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| React    | FastAPI | Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, cosine similarity) | Render / AWS (FreeTier) | GitHub, Postman, TailwindCSS |

My IDE is going to be WebStorm, for the better git integration through its terminal.

This project has started 12th June 2025.

##  Important note

This project aims to grow my personal knowledge as a programmer, so I am open to comments and suggestions.
